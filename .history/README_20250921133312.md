# MCP Architecture: AI Hotel Finder Agent

A demonstration of a robust and scalable architecture for implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in agentic AI workflows, showcased through an intelligent hotel-finding application.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build scalable, agentic AI systems using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It is structured to guide developers from the basic principles of MCP architecture to a fully functional, real-world application.

The project starts by outlining a generic, reusable architecture and then applies it to build an **Advanced Hotel Finder Agent**. This approach provides a clear blueprint that you can adapt for your own projects, showing how to connect Large Language Models to live, external tools in a standardized and maintainable way.

## Project Structure: From Concept to Application

To provide a clear learning path, this project is structured in two conceptual layers:

1.  **Foundational MCP Architecture:** The initial part of this README describes a generic and robust client-server architecture for MCP. This includes the roles of the **Host**, **Client**, and **Server**, and how they communicate. This serves as the theoretical blueprint for any MCP-based system.

2.  **Practical Application (Hotel Finder):** We then scale up this architecture with a concrete exampleâ€”an intelligent hotel finder built with Streamlit and the `agno` agent framework. This application demonstrates:
    *   A **Streamlit** app acting as the **MCP Host**.
    *   A **Perplexity-powered AI agent** acting as the **MCP Client**.
    *   An **MCP Server** that connects to live Airbnb data, providing a real-world tool for the agent.

This structure allows you to first understand the core concepts and then see them in action, providing a better perspective on how to build and scale your own agentic AI applications.

## Features

-   **MCP Host:** A Streamlit application serves as the user interface and orchestrator for the agent.
-   **MCP Client:** Managed by the `agno` library, it handles the discovery of and communication with MCP servers.
-   **MCP Server:** The project uses the `@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb` Node.js package, which acts as an MCP server providing real-time access to Airbnb's data.
-   **Standardized Communication:** Leverages JSON-RPC 2.0 for reliable data exchange between the agent and the Airbnb tool.
-   **Swappable AI Models:** The architecture allows for easy replacement of the LLM provider (e.g., from Perplexity to OpenAI, Anthropic, or others).
-   **Modularity:** The system can be easily extended by adding new MCP servers for different tools or services (e.g., weather, flight booking, local databases).
